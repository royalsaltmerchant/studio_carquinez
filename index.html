      <b>Brian Fogg</b>
      <p>I've been collecting gear and building this studio for the past several years with the intention of providing a low cost, large format, (mostly) analog recording experience to members of the Bay Area music community.</p>
      <p>I'm living here at the house with a lovely cast of housemates / engineers and I really enjoy hosting and recording artists. Especially excited to work with those who are recording new music.</p>
